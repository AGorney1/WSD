					<p> Polar bears need our help! There numbers are on the rise but they are not out of the woods yet. They are roughly about 20-25,000 left in
					the world. Decades of large scale hunting have raised concern for the future of the species but they have since rebound after controls have been 
					in effect.</p>

				<div><p> Polar bears are a large bear with an adule male weighing in at around 770 to 1500 pounds and females weighing about half of that.
				They have strong legs and flattened feet with webbing to help walk on ice and swimming. Polar bears are very strong swimmers and have seen swimming hundreds of miles
				from land. They are the largest carnivorous bear, rivaled only by the Kodiak brown bear, that lives mostly within the Arctic Circle. Polar bears are marine mammals and 
				spend much of their time on the Arctic sea ice.

				<p> Even though these bears are very large and independent they still need our help from being extinct. Norway is the only country in which 
				polar bear hunting is completely banned. The Soviet Russia does have a ban, except for the area of Chukotka due to the polar bears endangering humans.
				Greenland, Canada, and the USA have restrictions on how the hunting is done. In USA and Greenland it is banned except by indigenous people.</p>
				<p> There are many things that effect the ecosystem of the polar bears. Anything from an oil spill to pollution can harm the polar bears.
				They are at the top of there food chain in the Arctic but global warming is making it more difficult for them to survive. Rising temperatures 
				in the worldâ€™s oceans are causing sea ice to disappear for longer and longer periods during the late summer, leaving polar bears insufficient time to hunt.</p>
