				<p> Polar bears are a large bear with an adule male weighing in at around 770 to 1500 pounds and females weighing about half of that.
				They have strong legs and flattened feet with webbing to help walk on ice and swimming. Polar bears are very strong swimmers and have seen swimming hundreds of miles
				from land. They are the largest carnivorous bear, rivaled only by the Kodiak brown bear, that lives mostly within the Arctic Circle.</p>
